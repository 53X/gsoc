## Future works

Seperate out table into table and axtable:
* axtable -> behaves like a legend in that it's specifically attached to a plot
* table -> standalone plot/axis object

## Academic Experience


## Why this project?
've taught matplotlib so often that I'm kind of ashamed that I haven't contributed and this seems like a good entry point. 
I work with a lot of catagorical data, especially climate data, and so I've written loads of boilerplate to plot it nicely in matplotlib. 
So, I figure Iit just makes sense for me to  work on something that gets it into the project rather than having to keep writing ticker & formatter boilerplate.
