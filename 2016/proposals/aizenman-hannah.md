## Future works

Seperate out table into table and axtable:
* axtable -> behaves like a legend in that it's specifically attached to a plot
* table -> standalone plot/axis object

## Academic Experience

## Why this project?
I have taught matplotlib so often that I'm kind of ashamed that I haven't contributed and this seems like a good entry point. 
I work with a lot of catagorical data, especially climate data, and so I've written loads of boilerplate to plot it nicely in matplotlib and it'd be nice to have this all incorporated into the project in the proper way.
