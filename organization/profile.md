# Organization Profile

## Your details

-   Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code?

    Since NumFOCUS promotes and supports
    the ongoing research and development of open-source computing tools,
    e.g. AstroPy, Jupyter, IPython, Julia, rOpenSci, SymPy, ...,
    through educational, community, and public channels
    we thought that applying to participate in
    Google Summer of Code 2016 as a umbrella organization
    will be another way do our job.

    By participating we hope to offer to a great chance
    for novice users of open-source computating tools to
    become involved with the community.

-   How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?

    10.

-   How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

    We will contact mentors and students every two weeks to check if they are
    having any problems and if we could help with solving them.

    As an umbrella organization we will not enforce any policy between mentors
    and students because every community has its own rules and we respect those.

-   How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

    Request that students be as open as possible about their progress.
    This will involve that at least during the program the students blog their progress
    to the community every two weeks.
    We will also suggest that the students keep the issues/tickets on the
    bugtrack system used for the project updated.

    For cases where students are behind schedule we will request a video
    conference and discuss ways to get back on schedule.

-   How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?

    We will ask mentors to introduce the students to the community
    and offer suggestions to get involved, e.g. local groups, virtual meetings, ...

    We will request that students blog every two weeks about their progress
    so that the community knows of the project and provides feedback if they want.
    The students' blog should be included on the community blog aggregator.

-   How will you keep students involved in your community after GSoC?

    Every community has their own way of keeping the students involved in the
    community after GSoC and we will respect their way of work.
    As a umbrella organization we will do our best to provide an enjoyable summer
    experience for all the students and if possible help them find ways to get
    some revenue that facilitates their involvement with the community.
