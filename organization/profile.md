# Organization Profile

## Your details

-   Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code?

    NumFOCUS promotes and supports research and development of open-source
    computing tools. It is the fiscal sponsor for cutting-edge,
    high-profile
    data science and numeric computing tools such as numpy, pandas,
    Jupyter, Julia, and rOpenSci.

    NumFOCUS would like to participate in Google Summer of Code 2016 as an
    umbrella organization for these tools in continuance of its mission.
    By participating, we hope to provide our community with another
    opportunity
    to help develop critical pieces of the open-source data science and
    numeric computing ecosystem.

-   How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?

    10.

-   How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

    We plan to engage our project leaders and students on a regular basis to
    ensure that measurable, achievable goals are set for their Summer of
    Code projects, that progress is being made toward their completion,
    and that there is clear communication of expectations and adequate
    knowledge-sharing between mentors and students.

    Our individual projects have different organizing strategies, and we
    intend to respect these, relying on our board of directors and project
    management staff to also guarantee that Summer of Code participants
    will have a positive and rewarding experience and ensure that their
    participation in these projects will have clear, tangible results.

-   How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

    The NumFOCUS board of directors and individual project leaders have a
    wealth of experience as mentors and in managing volunteer
    contributions
    to their work from students.

    We believe that measurable, achievable goals and clear, transparent
    expectations are necessary in order to ensure that both students and
    the
    projects have a positive experience with the Summer of Code program.
    To
    facilitate this, we intend to meet with project leaders and students
    on
    a regular basis to allow them to report any issues they have
    encountered. Of course, for day-to-day progress on issues, we intend
    to
    use industry-standard tools (such as GitHub and Bugtraq.)

    Furthermore, we offer students some unique opportunities to share
    their
    work and their progress with the broader open source scientific and
    numeric computing community. We believe that these will also serve as
    incentives to keep their projects on track with tangible, presentable
    results. We intend to offer students the opportunity to present their
    medium-term and long-term progress to the entire NumFOCUS community
    via
    blog posts hosted and distributed on NumFOCUS.org, via sections in our
    regular newsletter, and via speaking opportunities at a PyData
    conference (http://pydata.org) and at one of our many, global PyData
    chapter meetups.

-   How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?

    The NumFOCUS and PyData community is passionate, engaged, and growing.
    We have eleven world-wide conferences planned for 2016 and chapters
    (meetups) popping up in every major city. We will offer students the
    opportunity to present their work at both PyData conferences and at
    PyData chapter meetups and facilitate connections to allow them to
    present their work at other, non-affiliated open source numeric,
    scientific computing, and data science events (e.g., SciPy, Strata,
    Dato
    Machine Learning Summit, etc.)

    Furthermore, we intend to ask students to present their progress to
    our
    community on a regular basis. We will promote these progress reports
    via
    the NumFOCUS newsletter, Twitter feed, and our public blog.

-   How will you keep students involved in your community after GSoC?

    We intend to invite GSoC participants to present their work at future
    PyData conferences and chapter meetups. Additionally, individual
    projects under NumFOCUS have their own respective communities, and
    have
    historically had great experiences involving and engaging volunteer
    contributors.

-   Has your org been accepted as a mentoring org in Google Summer of Code before?

    Yes

-   Which years did your org participate in GSoC?

    2015

-   What is your success/fail rate per year?

    All of the students that participated in GSoC 2015 succeeded in their
    project.

-   Are you part of a foundation/umbrella organization?

    No.

-   What year was your project started?

    NumFOCUS started on 2012.

## Descriptions

-   Short Description

-   Description

    NumFOCUS supports and promotes world-class, innovative, open source
    scientific software. Most individual projects, even the wildly successful
    ones, find the overhead of a non-profit to be too large for their community
    to bear. NumFOCUS provides a critical service as an umbrella organization
    for this projects.
