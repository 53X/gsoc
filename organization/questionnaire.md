-   Why is your organization applying to participate
    in Google Summer of Code 2015?
    What do you hope to gain by participating?*

    Since NumFOCUS promotes and supports
    the ongoing research and development of open-source computing tools,
    e.g. AstroPy, IPython, Julia, rOpenSci, SymPy, ...,
    through educational, community, and public channels
    we thought that applying to participate in
    Google Summer of Code 2015 as a umbrella organization
    will be another way do our job.

    By participating we hope to offer to a great chance
    to novice users of open-source computating tools
    became involved with the community.

    What criteria did you use to select them?

    10.

    Potential mentors should be active contributors to,
    at least one, open-source project supported by NumFOCUS.

-   What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students?

    We will to try to pick students who will not disappear
    by requiring all students to have submitted at least one patch
    that passes review and is pushed into the code base in order to be
    considered.
    
    To avoid the disappearing students we will require each student
    to (1) blog once a week about their progress
    and (2) keep their work updated in GitHub by,
    at least, one push a week.

    If a student disappears,
    the organization admins will try to sit down with the student
    to find what happens and what can be done to help the student.
    In case the student not reply to admins contact
    we will fail the student in his midterm or final evaluation.

-   What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors?

    We will try to have backup mentors for each project.

    In case of problems,
    we encourtage students to ask for help to the community.

-   What steps will you take to encourage students
    to interact with your project's community before and during the program?

    Request that students have at least one pull request accepted
    is one way to students interact with the community.

    During the program, the blog posts will advertise students progress
    to the community and they can always ask questions to the community.

-   What will you do to encourage your accepted students
    to stick with the project after Google Summer of Code concludes?

    We will encourage all accepted students to join
    Software Carpentry Foundation instructors team.
    That way students can transmit the knowledge gain during
    Google Summer of Code to their colleges.
