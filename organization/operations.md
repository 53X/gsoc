**This is a draft.**

Projects/organizations not supported by NumFOCUS
can participate at GSoC under NumFOCUS umbrella
if approved by NumFOCUS board.

## NumFOCUS Administrator for GSoC

The NumFOCUS board will indicate one person,
named in this document as **organization administrator**,
to be in charge of NumFOCUS application **for each edition** of GSoC.

The **organization administrator** is responsible for

-   create the initial application for NumFOCUS to apply for GSoC
-   advertise the application to **all** projects/organization supported
    by NumFOCUS
-   manage NumFOCUS profile at GSoC
-   request a minimum and a maximum number of slots
    that can accomodate the slots requested by each project/organization
    under NumFOCUS umbrella.

## Coordinators for GSoC

Each project/organization under NumFOCUS umbrella for GSoC
can indicate up to three names,
named in this document as **coordinators**,
to help the **organization administrator** managing NumFOCUS application.

**Coordinators** will have administrative access to
NumFOCUS profile at GSoC.

The **coordinators** are responsible for

-   advertise the application to the project/organization they represent
-   connect users with NumFOCUS profile
-   request to **organization administrator** a minimum and a maximum number of
    slots

## Scoring Students Proposals

Students proposals will be scoring following the description bellow.

-   **0 stars**: must be reject.
-   **1 star**: slot should be request and should be reject if not enough slots are received.
-   **2 stars**: slot should be request
-   **3 stars**: slot should be request and should be accepted even if few slots are received.

**Coordinators** and **mentors** should vote **only** in proposals
related with the project/organization they are involved.

**Organization administrator** will request one slot for every
proposal with at least one star.

## Guidelines to Select Accept Students Proposals

**Note**: Slots are requested after students submission
and will be done based on the number of stars that
**coordinators** and **mentors** assign to each proposal.

**Organization administrator** and **coordinators** will
discuss and accept/reject students proposal based on:

1.  the number of slots received;
2.  the score of each proposal;
3.  if the proposal already has at least one mentor;
4.  student background and proposal.

**If** NumFOCUS received few slots than projects/organizations
under its umbrella,  **organization administrator** and
**coordinators** will not accept more than one proposal
per project/organization. For decide which projects/organizations
receive one slot, **organization administrator** and **coordinators**
will considere

1.  which project/organization can only apply under NumFOCUS umbrella;
2.  if the project/organization has enough mentors for the proposal;
3.  if the project/organization receive proposals from strong candidates.
4.  If the organization already has plenty of slots from another umbrella
    organization.

**If** NumFOCUS received few slots than requested,
**organization administrator** and **coordinators**
will try to accept at least one proposal per project/organization
considering the same items from the previous case.
